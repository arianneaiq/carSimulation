## Usage

### Case description 
We want to implement a simulation for a car accelerating and breaking. Each car has a current speed. This 
speed can become higher (by accelerating) or smaller (by breaking). Every car has a maximum speed, for 
example a Ferrari has a much higher maximum speed than a Fiat Panda. 

### User interaction 
The application should display some information about a car. There are two buttons to modify the speed 
of a car. Clicking one of the buttons should result in updating some data in the car-object and showing 
information about the car in the label.
